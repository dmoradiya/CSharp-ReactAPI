      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        React Notes:
        1) Index.js identifies the root element of the page in which to render. Then ReactDOM.render is called therein which calls all other components. (Starting with App)
        2) App.js  will reference the various Routes and render the component in question based on our current path in a Layout component. (Root would be Home, /counter would be Counter, etc)
        3) The components/Layout.js file will take care of the page layout, including the NavMenu, and render the main component as well.
        3a) components/Home.js contains the JSX to render the home page.
        3b) components/Counter.js contains the JSX and methods to render our counter page.
        3c) components/FetchData.js contains the JSX and methods to render our API output.
